The following visualization is inspired from Shazam Music Recognition Alogorithm to find out the song based on its signature developed from the features and attributes of the song.

My contributions 

1. Developing signature graph technique that ideally matched songs graph based on its temporal features, songs with similar graphs was an approach to recommend similar melodic songs to people.
2. Data Cleaning using python predicting missing values, excluding duplicates and transforming the temporal data for efficient visualization.
